## Getting Started

All contributions welcome, not just code.

### Technologies

- NextJS (AppRouter)
- Prisma
- Postgres
- LinkedIn OAuth

### Local development

This environment is fully on your computer and requires each dependency to be installed and set up, but it gives you the most flexibility for customisation.

#### Prerequisites

NodeJS, Postgres and LinkedIn OAuth

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the parameters.
   - For LinkedIn parameters, create a developer app [here](https://developer.linkedin.com).
  
#### Environment Variables

| ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE   | EXAMPLE VALUE                                                          | DESCRIPTION                                 |

1. Install the dependencies using `npm ci` from the package lock file (do not use `npm install` unless for a specific reason).
2. Ensure your Postgres server is running on `localhost:5432` with the default username and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` set as `password`. To start a Postgres server using Docker and Compose, use `docker compose -f postgres.compose.yaml up`.
3. Create the database tables by running `npm run db:dev:migrate` (for production, use `npm run db:prod:migrate`).
4. Seed the database by inserting example data with `npm run db:dev:seed` (if you need to reset the database, use `npm run db:dev:reset`).
5. Start the local development server with `npm run dev`.

### Local Development with Docker Compose

This will allow you to use your favorite IDE without having to install any dependencies on your computer.

#### Prerequisites

Docker and Docker Compose Installed

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root of the directory.
2. 1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the parameters. Please looks at [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.
   - For LinkedIn parameters, create a developer app [here](https://developer.linkedin.com).
   - There is no need to chnage the postgres URL it's arelegy set in [compose.yaml](compose.yaml) file.
3. Run `docker compose up`.
4. In your browser, go to `localhost:3000`, and you should see the project up and running.
